<h1>Password Strength Checker</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Password strength checker is a program in which users can check the strength of their password. The problem to solve is to help users determine if their password is weak, moderate, or strong. I will create a program to solve this problem. When executed, the program will ask a user to enter the password they want to check. The program will evaluate the password using the following criteria:
- at least 1 lowercase character - at least 1 uppercase character - at least 1 digit
- at least 1 special character
- length at least 8 characters
After evaluating the password, the program will output (display) the password strength
( weak, moderate, or strong) based on how many criteria were met (1-3 for weak password,
4 for moderate password, and 5 for a strong password).
